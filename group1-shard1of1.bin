This is a placeholder for the model weights file. In a real deployment, this file would contain the trained weights for the model. Since this is just a demonstration, we're using a dummy file.

To use a real model, you would need to:
1. Train a model using TensorFlow or Keras
2. Convert it to TensorFlow.js format using tensorflowjs_converter
3. Replace this file with the actual weights file(s)
